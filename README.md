ADSB Plane Tracker

This repo was initially forked from [c0wsaysmoo' repository](https://github.com/c0wsaysmoo/plane-tracker-rgb-pi). I initially discovered [their reddit post on r/delta](https://www.reddit.com/r/delta/comments/1g4wsi6/weird_delta_flight_over_my_house_this_morning/) and decided to fork it. After many modifications to make it my own I decided to detach it, as it became very different on the backend from theirs, so much credit to them for getting me started here.

I'll update this README when the project is in more of a state to share with others who may want to build one of their own.
